      <span className='skillTitle'>About Me</span>
      <span className='skillDescription'>I am a Software Engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, cloud deployment, and modern software architecture. Originally from Brazil, I began my journey in technology with a background in Medical Physics, later transitioning into software engineering to pursue my passion for building scalable, user-centered solutions.
        <br/><br/>In 2022 I relocated to the United States and earned a Master of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering from Seattle University. This experience sharpened both my technical and problem-solving skills, and deepened my commitment to continuous learning and innovation.
        I have since developed and deployed web and mobile applications using technologies such as React, Node.js, Flutter and Firebase. I bring a user-first mindset, a collaborative work ethic, and a strong ability to adapt quickly in fast-paced environments. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to contribute to impactful products and grow as an engineer alongside a motivated and mission-driven team.
        <br/><br/>This portfolio website is an example of my workâ€”designed and developed using React library for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It features a custom-built RESTful API to handle contact form submissions, with Mailgun.js integrated for secure email delivery. 
        The site is hosted on Render and configured with a custom domain. This project reflects my emphasis on clean design, modular architecture, and real-world functionality across both frontend and backend development.

        <br/><br/>The following are some of the programming languages and frameworks with which I have worked:
