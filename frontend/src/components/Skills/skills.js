      <span className='skillTitle'>About Me</span>
      <span className='skillDescription'>I am a Software Engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, cloud deployment, and modern software architecture. Originally from Brazil, I began my journey in technology with a background in Medical Physics, later transitioning into software engineering to pursue my passion for building scalable, user-centered solutions.

After teaching myself English, I relocated to the United States and earned a Master of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering from Seattle University. This experience sharpened both my technical and problem-solving skills, and deepened my commitment to continuous learning and innovation.

I have since developed and deployed web and mobile applications using technologies such as React, Node.js, Flutter, Firebase, Docker, and Google Cloud. I bring a user-first mindset, a collaborative work ethic, and a strong ability to adapt quickly in fast-paced environments. Iâ€™m particularly interested in roles that allow me to contribute to impactful products and grow as an engineer alongside a motivated and mission-driven team.</span>
